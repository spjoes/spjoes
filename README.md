# 👋 Hi there !
I'm Joey but I go by IAmThePerson online. I started programming on scratch.mit.edu back in 2013 on my first computer and started learning my first text-based programming, HTML/CSS, shortly after. Back in 2017 I started my first ever Java project, a Minecraft 1.12.2 mod called Extra-Ons. Now, I mainly focus on Javascript/Nodejs, Java, building website's, and PCB design. I love everything Nintendo and video game preservation wise. I also own https://persn.dev where you can find my other projects i've worked on such as [Eggium](https://eggium.net) and [Ghostberry](https://ghostberry.net).
